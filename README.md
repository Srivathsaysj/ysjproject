Security is an important part of any application that encompasses critical functionality. This can be as simple as securing your database from attacks by nefarious actors or as complex as applying fraud processing to a qualified lead before importing them into your platform.

Security applies at every phase of the software development life cycle (SDLC) and needs to be at the forefront of your developers’ minds as they implement your software’s requirements. In this article, we’ll explore ways to create a secure SDLC, helping you catch issues in requirements before they manifest as security problems in production.

With dedicated effort, security issues can be addressed in the SDLC pipeline well before deployment to production. This reduces the risk of finding security vulnerabilities in your app and works to minimize the impact when they are found.
